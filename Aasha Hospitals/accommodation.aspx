                                        Sophisticated medical care is very essential these days, but nevertheless, it is essential that accommodation provided must be equally attractive for the patient to feel comfortable. Aasha Hospital has gone that extra way to provide a room environ that will promote the well-being and quick recovery of the patient. No compromise has been made in incurring cost on accommodation as Aasha Hospital has felt the need to lay much focus on patient care.

                                                    Hospital stay is usually an unnerving experience and results in perhaps the patient wanting to leave quickly. Usually, of course, a patient does not want to over-stay, but at Aasha Hospital the room service and facilities provide much comfort for the patient to bear his body discomfort and pain.
