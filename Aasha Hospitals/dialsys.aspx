                                        Its strength lies in its quality equipment, well-qualified nephrologists, competent nursing staff and attendants and an environ that makes the patient comfortable while undergoing treatment. All kinds of kidney related surgeries are conducted, even those involving other health complications. For example, if patient was suffering from cancer or perhaps orthpaedic problem, then also our kidney surgeons are willing to perform the operations. Even head injuries as well as joint replacements are taken care of while performing kidney surgeries. Our kidney surgeons can handle complicated cases competently as they have the requisite know-how.

                                                    Kidney malfunctioning is a serious health issue and initially it may start as a disease and eventually turn chronic requiring regular dialysis. Renal failure entails dialysis, which cannot be stopped on any account as the patient has to be on dialysis for ever.

                                Is Aasha Hospital the right place for Kidney treatment ?
                            </h3>

                            <p>
                                Yes, of course. One can expect the cost-effective treatment which is of international level and would make the patient feel hale and hearty after the dialysis is over.

                                The dialysis centre is well-equipped with the latest modern dialysis equipment. Air-conditioned room with a television to pass time while undergoing the dialysis makes the patient feel relaxed. The cost per dialysis is much reasonable as compared to other multi-specialty corporate hospitals. Hygiene is maintained to avoid any uncalled for infections. The attending staff and nurses take good care, maintaining a friendly rapport with patients.

                                Undergoing dialysis involves much time and the patient would definitely look at the surrounding atmosphere. A congenial environ will make him or her want to continue with the dialysis, as it is difficult to spend 3 to 4 hours lying down during the treatment.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="topmargin_0 ">Aasha Hospital handles Kidney patients with extra care ?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Personal touch is what we at Aasha Hospital believe and a conscious effort is made to bridge the communication gap between the patient and the nephrologists. The smooth flow of communication enables the surgeon to perform his or her tasks well and also the dialysis patient to take it easy while being treated.

                                Aasha Hospital has gained much popularity for its successful kidney operations and naturally, the kidney dialysis center will cater to the needs of the patient successfully. The focus is on achieving success by making the patient the centre of all activity.
